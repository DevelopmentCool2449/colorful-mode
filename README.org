ðŸŸ colorful-mode is a minor mode that allow you preview *color hex* and
*color names*, in your current buffer in a user friendly way based on
ðŸŒˆ[[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/rainbow-mode.html][rainbow-mode.el]].

* Features ðŸ”§
- Preview emacs colors names and hex in your current buffer /(soon
  support for CSS rgb)/.
- Changing highlighted colors to other formats.
- Preview colors with highlights or using a prefix string.

* Screenshots and animated GIFs ðŸ“·

* Installation ðŸ“¦
Currently colorful-mode is not available in any elisp package archive,
however you can install it with =package-vc-install=

Run =M-x package-vc-install=
And type =https://github.com/DevelopmentCool2449/colorful-mode.git=

For emacs 30 users you can use =use-package=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package colorful-mode
    :vc (:url "https://github.com/DevelopmentCool2449/colorful-mode.git"
              :rev :newest)
    ...)
#+end_src

* How does it compare to =rainbow-mode=?
=colorful-mode= improves =rainbow-mode= in adding more features
and fixing some /(and old)/ bugs.

The intention is to provide a featured alternative to =rainbow.el=
with a user-friendy approach


* Plans for future
Currently this repo will only be used for feature-request /(i can't
promise to do them)/, send bug reports, and feedback /(i would greatly
appreciate this since i'm not expert in elisp)/.

Due I have plans for submit it to *GNU ELPA* /(and maybe MELPA)/ *Pull
Resquest will not be accepted* (unless your contribution is less than
15 lines [see: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Copyright-Assignment.html][Copyright Assignment]]] and this package is ready for
submit to ELPA and you are willing to assign copyright to FSF)

Also i will try to make this package as stable as possible before
submit it to ELPA, later that *I won't be able to be the mantainer* of
this package, However I would like if someone would be able to be the
mantainer (if you are interested please email me
<eg642616@gmail.com>).

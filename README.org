* User Setup and Guides üìñ
** Customizable User options
- =colorful-allow-mouse-clicks (default: t)= If non-nil, allow using mouse buttons
  for change color.
- =colorful-use-prefix (default: nil)= If non-nil, use prefix for preview color
  instead highlight them.
- =colorful-prefix-string (default: "‚óè")= Prefix symbol to be used according
  =colorful-use-prefix=.
- =colorful-prefix-alignment (default: 'left)= The position to put prefix string.
  The value can be left or right.
- =colorful-extra-color-keywords-hook (default: nil)= Hook used for add extra color
  keywords to =colorful-color-keywords=.
  Available functions are: =colorful-add-color-names=.
- =colorful-exclude-colors (default: '("#def"))= List of keyword to don't highlight.
- =colorful-short-hex-convertions (default: t)= If non nil, hex
  values converted by coloful should be as short as possible.
  Setting this to t will make hex values follow a 24-bit specification
  and can make them inaccurate.
- =global-colorful-modes (default: '(mhtml-mode html-ts-mode css-mode css-ts-mode emacs-lisp-mode))= Which major modes colorful-mode is switched on in (globally).

** Interactive User Functions.

- =colorful-mode= Buffer-local minor mode.
- =global-colorful-mode= Global minor mode.

** Key bindings
These key bindings are defined by: =colorful-mode-map=
- =C-c c c= ‚Üí =colorful-change-color=.

** Adding extra colors
Colorful by default provides extra functions that highlight additional
colors:

- =colorful-add-color-names= Add emacs color names to colorful-color-keywords.

For use them add it to =colorful-extra-color-keywords-hook=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; In this example highlight emacs color names.
(add-hook 'colorful-extra-color-keywords-hook #'colorful-add-color-names)
#+end_src

* Installation üì¶
Currently colorful-mode is not available in any elisp package archive,
however you can install it with =package-vc-install=

Run =M-x package-vc-install=
And type =https://github.com/DevelopmentCool2449/colorful-mode.git=

For emacs 30 users you can use =use-package=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package colorful-mode
    :vc (:url "https://github.com/DevelopmentCool2449/colorful-mode.git"
              :rev :newest)
    ...)
#+end_src

* How does it compare to =rainbow-mode=?
=colorful-mode= improves =rainbow-mode= in adding more features
and fixing some /(and old)/ bugs:

| Comparation                                             | colorful-mode.el | rainbow-mode.el |
|---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-----------------|
| Compatible with hl-line and other overlays?             | ‚úì                | ‚ùå              |
| Convert color to other formats?                         | ‚úì                | ‚ùå              |
| Insert open color hex                                   | not yet          | ‚ùå(?)           |
| Opcionally use string preffix/suffix instead highlight  | ‚úì                | ‚ùå              |
| Use emacs built-in functions instead define custom ones | ‚úì^{1}               | ‚úì^{2}              |
| No performance issues?^{3}                                 | ‚ùå               | ‚úì               |

1. However colorful defines helper funtion for some cases avoiding
    innecesary computation.
2. Only for some cases.
3. I didn't a benchmark however due colorful-mode uses overlays
    instead text properties (like rainbow-mode) it can be a bit slow.

The intention is to provide a featured alternative to
=rainbow-mode.el= with a user-friendy approach

If you prefer only highlights without color convertion or
preffix/suffix you can use =rainbow-mode.el=.

On the other hand, if you want convert colors, overlays and
optional prefix strings you can use =colorful-mode.el=.

* Plans for future
Currently this repo will only be used for feature-request /(i can't
promise to do them)/, send bug reports, and feedback /(i would greatly
appreciate this since i'm not expert in elisp)/.

Due I have plans for submit it to *GNU ELPA* /(and maybe MELPA)/ *Pull
Resquest will not be accepted* (unless your contribution is less than
15 lines [see: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Copyright-Assignment.html][Copyright Assignment]]] and this package is ready for
submit to ELPA and you are willing to assign copyright to FSF)

Also i will try to make this package as stable as possible before
submit it to ELPA, later that *I won't be able to be the mantainer* of
this package, However I would like if someone would be able to be the
mantainer (if you are interested please email me
<eg642616@gmail.com>).

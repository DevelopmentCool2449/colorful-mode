  instead highlight them.

* Installation 📦
Currently colorful-mode is not available in any elisp package archive,
however you can install it with =package-vc-install=

Run =M-x package-vc-install=
And type =https://github.com/DevelopmentCool2449/colorful-mode.git=

For emacs 30 users you can use =use-package=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package colorful-mode
    :vc (:url "https://github.com/DevelopmentCool2449/colorful-mode.git"
              :rev :newest)
    ...)
#+end_src

* How does it compare to =rainbow-mode=?
=colorful-mode= improves =rainbow-mode= in adding more features
and fixing some /(and old)/ bugs like:
- The well know issue with hl-line.
- Deprecated (and some old functions) in source code.
- Refactoring.
- &c.

The intention is to provide a featured alternative to
=rainbow-mode.el= with a user-friendy approach

* Plans for future
Currently this repo will only be used for feature-request /(i can't
promise to do them)/, send bug reports, and feedback /(i would greatly
appreciate this since i'm not expert in elisp)/.

Due I have plans for submit it to *GNU ELPA* /(and maybe MELPA)/ *Pull
Resquest will not be accepted* (unless your contribution is less than
15 lines [see: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Copyright-Assignment.html][Copyright Assignment]]] and this package is ready for
submit to ELPA and you are willing to assign copyright to FSF)

Also i will try to make this package as stable as possible before
submit it to ELPA, later that *I won't be able to be the mantainer* of
this package, However I would like if someone would be able to be the
mantainer (if you are interested please email me
<eg642616@gmail.com>).
